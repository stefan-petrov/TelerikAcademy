 is a general purpose ming object oriented language 
invented around 1999 or 2000 by Anders Hejlsberg at Microsoft. 
It is very similar to Java in its syntax with a major difference 
being that all variable types are descended from a common ancestor 
class.
The purpose of  is to precisely define a series of operations 
that a computer can perform to accomplish a task. Most of these 
operations involve manipulating numbers and text, but anything 
that the computer can physically do can be med in . 
Computers have no intelligence- they have to be told exactly 
what to do and this is defined by the ming language you use. 
Once med they can repeat the steps as many times as you wish 
at very high speed. Modern s are so fast they can count to a 
billion in a second or two.
Typical ming tasks includes putting data into a database 
or pulling it out, displaying high speed graphics in a game or video, 
controlling electronic devices attached to the  or even playing 
 and/or sound effects. You can even write software to generate 
 or help you compose.
Some developers believe that  is too slow for games, because it 
is interpreted. However the .NET runtime compiles the interpreted 
code (called CIL) the first time it is run.
